Below is **the same full deployment guide**, but rewritten to clearly explain **WHAT we did** and **WHY we did it** in each step — in simple, understandable terms.

You can **copy & paste this into Google Docs**.

# **PHP (Laravel) App Deployment – What We Did & Why (Step-by-Step Explanation)**

This explains every step we performed to deploy the **Hrmifly SaaS (Laravel) HRMS application** on CyberPanel/OpenLiteSpeed, along with the *purpose* of each step.

---

# **1. Created a Website in CyberPanel**

### **What we did**

* Opened CyberPanel → Websites → Create Website
* Added the domain: `hrms.slateai.dev`
* Selected PHP version 8.x

### **Why we did it**

CyberPanel needs a website entry so that:

* it creates file directories under `/home/`
* it generates a Linux user for the domain
* it configures OpenLiteSpeed
* it allows us to upload files, create database, SSL, etc.

---

# **2. Uploaded the PHP Application Code**

### **What we did**

* Uploaded the `.zip` file in File Manager
* Extracted it inside `/home/hrms.slateai.dev/public_html/`
* It created a folder: `HrmiflySaas-2.0.0`

### **Why we did it**

The extracted PHP files must exist inside the website directory so the server can execute them.

---

# **3. Installed Composer**

### **What we did**

We installed Composer manually:

```bash
cd /usr/local/bin
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
rm composer-setup.php
composer --version
```

### **Why we did it**

Composer is required to install PHP libraries used by Laravel.
Without Composer, Laravel apps cannot run.

---

# **4. Installed Laravel Dependencies**

### **What we did**

Ran inside the project folder:

```bash
composer install
```

### **Why we did it**

Laravel does not ship with all packages in the ZIP file.
Composer installs:

* vendor libraries
* framework components
* dependencies required to run the application

---

# **5. Fixed File Permissions**

### **What we did**

We changed owner and permissions:

```bash
chown -R hrmss4546:hrmss4546 /home/hrms.slateai.dev/public_html/HrmiflySaas-2.0.0
chmod -R 775 storage
chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache
```

### **Why we did it**

Because:

* Files were extracted as **root**, not the domain user
* Laravel requires `storage` & `bootstrap/cache` to be writable
* Without permissions, Laravel throws 500 errors

This step ensures the web server can read & write files properly.

---

# **6. Created MySQL Database & User**

### **What we did**

In CyberPanel → Create Database:

* Database: `hrms_hrmsdb`
* User: `hrms_hrmsuser`
* Password: your chosen password

### **Why we did it**

Laravel needs:

* a database for tables
* a username/password to connect

The installer uses this information to configure `.env`.

---

# **7. Updated the `.env` File**

### What we did

Opened the `.env` file:

```bash
nano .env
```

Updated these fields:

```
APP_URL=https://hrms.slateai.dev

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=hrms_hrmsdb
DB_USERNAME=hrms_hrmsuser
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

### **Why we did it**

The `.env` file tells Laravel:

* what URL the app is running on
* which database to use
* which user/password to connect with

This is Laravel’s main configuration file.

---

# **8. Cleared Laravel Cache**

### **What we did**

Ran:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan optimize
```

### **Why we did it**

Laravel stores cached:

* configuration
* routes
* views

Old cache can break the app.
Clearing + optimizing ensures Laravel loads fresh configuration.

---

# **9. Ran Database Migrations**

### **What we did**

```bash
php artisan migrate --force
```

Then:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --force
```

### **Why we did it**

Migration:

* Creates all database tables needed by the app

Seeding:

* Inserts default data such as admin roles, settings, modules, etc.

Without these, the app cannot run.

---

# **10. Pointed OpenLiteSpeed Document Root to `/public`**

### **What we did**

In OpenLiteSpeed Admin:

* Virtual Hosts → hrms.slateai.dev → General
* Changed Document Root to:

```
/home/hrms.slateai.dev/public_html/HrmiflySaas-2.0.0/public
```

Performed a **graceful restart**.

### **Why we did it**

Laravel apps must always serve the `/public` folder — not the root folder.

The `/public` directory:

* contains `index.php`
* loads the framework
* protects sensitive files from being exposed

Without this, the app shows 404 or downloads PHP files.

---

# **11. Completed the Web Installer**

### **What we did**

Opened:

```
https://hrms.slateai.dev/install/environment
```

Entered:

* Host: `localhost`
* DB User: `hrms_hrmsuser`
* Password: the DB password
* DB Name: `hrms_hrmsdb`

### **Why we did it**

Many SaaS Laravel scripts include their own installer.
This step:

* writes database settings
* completes application setup
* generates necessary environment configs

---

# **12. Application Successfully Loaded**

### **What we did**

Opened:

```
https://hrms.slateai.dev
```

The application loaded without errors.

### **Why it worked**

Because:

* composer installed dependencies
* database migrations were run
* permissions were fixed
* `.env` was correctly configured
* document root pointed to `/public`

# **If you want, I can also prepare:**

✔ A **short version**
✔ A **diagram flow**
✔ A **ready Google Docs formatted version**
✔ A **version for Node.js, WordPress, Docker, or EC2 deployment**

Just tell me:

**“convert this to Google Docs format”**
or
**“give me a short version”**
